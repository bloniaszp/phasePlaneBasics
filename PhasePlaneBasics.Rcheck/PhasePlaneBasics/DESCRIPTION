Description: Provides functions to draw phase arrows and nullclines
  for 2D dynamical systems. It is designed to allow students to 
  easily plot nullclines and phase arrows in one and 
  two dimensional ODEs. Modified from the original script pplane.r written by Daniel Kaplan,
  Dept. of Mathematics, Macalester College, kaplan@macalester.edu
  Modifications by S. Ellner for use in connection with the textbook
  Dynamic Models in Biology by S.P. Ellner and J. Guckenheimer,
  Princeton University Press (2006).
  Further Modifications by Patrick F. Bloniasz for use in connection with Math 1808
  Biomathematics at Bowdoin College. The code has been condensed to only have
  phase planes and nullclines. This script is being used under the presumption of
